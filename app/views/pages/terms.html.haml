  %h1 Terms of Service
  %h2 1. Acceptance of the Terms of Service
  %p Welcome to <strong>Share a Prayer</strong>, a product of Share a Prayer, Inc. (a.k.a. <strong>"we"</strong> or <strong>"us"</strong> or the <strong>"Company"</strong> or <strong>"Share a Prayer"</strong>). We are excited to have you as user and member of the community. The following terms and conditions (collectively, these <strong>"Terms of Service"</strong>) apply to your use of shareaprayer.org (and any subdomains), including any content, functionality and services offered on or via shareaprayer.org (the <strong>"Website"</strong>). The Terms of Service also include our <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>, that you can review here: #{link_to "http://www.shareaprayer.org/privacy", page_path("privacy")}
  %p We want to keep our relationship with you as lean and informal as possible, but please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start using Docracy, because <strong>by using the Website you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service</strong>.
  %p Should you disagree with some of the provisions herein, you can either leave the Website (although we'll be sad to see you go!), or contact us at support@shareaprayer.org. <strong>Share a Prayer is all about bringing people together</strong>, and we'll be happy to hear your comments and suggestions.
  %h2 2. Changes to the Terms of Service and the Website
  %p Share a Prayer is a work in progress, meaning that a lot will change in the near future. We reserve the right to update the Website and these Terms of Service from time to time, at our discretion. We will make sure to announce any major change in a prominent way, but since "major" is a very subjective concept, you are always welcome to check back here from time to time for changes. <strong>Your continued use of the Website following the publishing of updated Terms of Service means that you accept and agree to the changes.</strong>
  %h2 3. Accessing the Website, Security, and Privacy
  %p We are working hard on improving Share a Prayer, but we can't guarantee that the Website will be up and running 24/7. We also reserve the right to suspend or restrict access to some features to users. In any case, we will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Website is unavailable at any time or for any period, nor for any data loss (see also section 7 below).
  %p To access certain features of the Website you have to register as part of our security procedures by either a) signing in with Facebook, or b) entering your email and choosing a password. You must treat such information as confidential, not disclosing it to any third party and only using Share a Prayer in person. There is a password reset procedure in case you forget your password, but please notify us of any breach of security. We highly recommend to choose a strong password (e.g. "#{link_to "correcthorsebatterystaple", "http://xkcd.com/936/"}") and that you log out from your account at the end of every session.
  %p It is a condition of your use of the Website that all the information you provide on the Website is correct, current, and complete. In the future, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information.

    %li The Paid Service is billed in advance and on a monthly basis.
    %li Pre-disclosed setup fees may apply when signing up for the Paid Service.
    %li You will be billed immediately for any upgrades or downgrades in plan level, and such bills shall not be subject to proration. You may be charged additional, pre-disclosed setup fees when upgrading your plan level. These charges shall also be immediate.
    %li All payments for the Paid Service are non-refundable. No refunds or credits for partial months of service, or upgrade/downgrade refunds will be issued. We may choose, under certain circumstances, to issue a refund at our sole discretion. This choice shall not affect the enforceability of rest of the Terms of Service, as set forth in section 10.
    %li All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties.
    %li Downgrading your Paid Service may cause loss of features or functionality for your church’s page or users associated with your church’s page. We do not accept any liability for such losses.

    %li We, in our sole discretion, have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Paid Service, or any other Service, for any reason at any time. Such termination of the Paid Service will result in the deactivation or deletion of any Content associated with the Paid Service, including your church’s page and any prayer requests posted within; the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Content associated with the Paid Service; and the forfeiture of the remaining month’s payment, without refund or credit.
